# aporeto_go

My first Go project.

This command line tool takes in a list of comma seperated urls, and for each url creates a file of each word on the page and corresponding frequency of word.

Build with `build gosample.go`

Usage of ./gosample:
  -urls string
      comma seperated list of urls (default "http://www.google.com")
